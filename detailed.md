* The BLAST bus uses half-duplex MAX3088 drivers for RS-485 control (clock, strobe and data). These are independently powered and opto-isolated on the sending and receiving end. For the card to receive serial sync signals from the UBC sync box, this stage must be powered. On the PCI card side, one has the option of powering the IO stage using PCI power taken off the daughter card. For safety, rather than drawing from the bus, we power the IO stage using a connector to the computer supply. A separate RS-232 serial link sends commands to the sync box from the same computer.
* If the sync box's power cycles, `act_timing` needs to be restarted as `sudo /etc/init.d/act_timing restart`.
